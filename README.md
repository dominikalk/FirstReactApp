# FirstReactApp
This is my first React web app and it was made part of a course on Pluralsight

To run the web app run these in the CLI within the folder:

npm install #Installs all the dependancies (You must have node package manager installed for this to work)

npm start #Compiles the code and opens index.html in the browser

(ctrl + c to end)
